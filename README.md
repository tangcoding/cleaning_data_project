=====================

The script run_analysis.R should be in the same folder as the Samsung data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

It will read the data in test and train folder and merge them to create one data set, extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, and label the data set with descriptive variable names. 

At the end, it will write a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
